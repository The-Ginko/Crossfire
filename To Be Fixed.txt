Star Puck Raw has too many nodes, it causes the game to load slowly at the start.
The Star Puck . png isn't square, it should be and it should match.
Star Puck Raw should be fixed and a new Png should be generated from it or StarPuck.png needs to make a new SVG... Something

"üõ† Workflow: Re‚Äëexporting a centered, square StarPuck PNG from the SVG
1. Open the raw SVG
Open StarPuck_Raw.svg in Inkscape (or Photopea if you prefer browser‚Äëbased).

Make sure you‚Äôre looking at the actual <path> that defines the star.

2. Fit the page to the artwork
In Inkscape:

File ‚Üí Document Properties ‚Üí Resize page to drawing or selection.

This trims the page to the star‚Äôs true bounding box.

Now the star is exactly filling the page, no extra margins.

3. Make the canvas square
Still in Document Properties, set Width = Height to the larger of the two dimensions.

Example: if the star‚Äôs bounds are 1448√ó1360, set both to 1448.

The star will now be centered horizontally but may sit off vertically.

4. Center the star on the new square canvas
Select the star path.

Use Object ‚Üí Align and Distribute (Shift+Ctrl+A).

Choose Relative to: Page.

Click Center on vertical axis and Center on horizontal axis.

Now the star is dead‚Äëcenter in a square canvas.

5. Export to PNG
File ‚Üí Export PNG Image (Shift+Ctrl+E).

Export Area: Page.

Size: set to your target (e.g. 512√ó512, 1024√ó1024).

Background: transparent.

Export.

6. Verify
Open the PNG in Photopea or your engine.

Drop guides at half the width/height ‚Äî the star should be perfectly centered.

In Matter.js, with setOrigin(0.5,0.5), the sprite and SVG‚Äëderived body will now align.

‚öñÔ∏è Why this works
The SVG path defines the body.

By exporting the PNG from the same SVG, with the page resized and centered, you guarantee both assets share the same coordinate system.

No more oddball aspect ratios, no more guessing offsets.

üëâ Once you do this once, you‚Äôll have a square, centered StarPuck.png that matches your SVG body exactly. From there, your code can stay clean: setOrigin(0.5,0.5) and no offsets."



Here‚Äôs a focused next‚Äësteps checklist to carry the arena from ‚Äúfeature‚Äëcomplete‚Äù to ‚Äúgame‚Äëready,‚Äù with an eye toward launcher integration and polish:

üéØ Physics & Geometry
Launcher integration test:

Drop in a prototype launcher and fire test balls.

Observe how balls interact with wedges and throat diagonals.

Adjust wedgeLongSide until the funneling feels authentic.

Collision smoothing:

Check for any micro‚Äëgaps between wedges, walls, and sensors.

Add tiny overlaps or chamfers if balls snag.

Scaling validation:

Scale arena up/down by changing puckSpanPx.

Confirm all proportions (walls, wedges, sensors) remain consistent.

üé® Visual Alignment
Overlay debug graphics:

Draw outlines of wedges, walls, and sensors with Phaser graphics.

Verify colinearity visually before importing art assets.

Asset alignment:

Once art is ready, ensure sprites line up with physics bodies.

Adjust offsets or anchor points if needed.

‚öôÔ∏è Gameplay Tuning
Ball flow tests:

Launch balls at different angles/speeds.

Confirm they funnel reliably into goals without bouncing out.

Sensor accuracy:

Verify sensors trigger only when balls fully cross the goal line.

Adjust sensor width if false positives/negatives occur.

Back wall rebound:

Check that balls hitting the back wall behave as expected (no clipping or sticking).

üõ†Ô∏è Future‚Äëproofing
Parameter centralization:

Keep wedgeLongSide, wedgeHRequired, goalDepth, throatInset at the top of the file.

This ensures all future tweaks are one‚Äëline changes.

Logging hooks:

Maintain console logs for wedge vertices and centroids until geometry is locked.

Remove or gate them behind a debug flag later.

Launcher geometry coupling:

Plan to tie wedgeLongSide to launcher mouth width or ball trajectory envelope once those are finalized.

‚úÖ Final polish checklist before ‚Äúdone‚Äù
[ ] Wedges funnel balls cleanly into sensors.

[ ] No visible seams between wedges and walls.

[ ] Long side length tuned to launcher geometry.

[ ] All dimensions scale correctly with puck size.

[ ] Visual assets align pixel‚Äëperfect with physics bodies.



Keep a simple table (in comments or a separate doc) that shows which categories collide with which. This is your ‚Äústreet map‚Äù for masks.

Category	Hex/Bit	Collides With (mask includes‚Ä¶)
BALL	0x0001	BALL, PUCK, ARENA, SENSOR, ATTRACTOR
PUCK	0x0002	BALL, ARENA, SENSOR
ARENA	0x0004	BALL, PUCK
SENSOR	0x0008	BALL, PUCK
ATTRACTOR	0x0010	BALL (but only pulls if ball.attracted = true)
